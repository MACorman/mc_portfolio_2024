      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I am a Chicago-based full-stack software engineer with an eye for detail
        and desire to know more. While working primarily in Ruby and JavaScript
        frameworks, I have delighted in creating applications from ideation and
        planning through to completion. I am passionate about solving problems -
        whether they be bugs in the code or the impetus for my next big project.{" "}
